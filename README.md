## Usage

&emsp;1\. install this extension in VSCode  
&emsp;1.5. manually set `custom-contextmenu.workbenchPath` (the auto-detection likely does not work) by locating your VS Code installation (e.g., right-click the VS Code shortcut and choose "Open file location"), searching for `workbench.html`/`workbench.esm.html`, then right-clicking the file and choosing "Copy as path"; set that path and re-run `Enable Custom Context Menu`  
&emsp;2. open Command Pallete with `F1` or `ctrl+shift+p`  
&emsp;3. select `Enable Custom Context Menu`  

### Selectors configuration

Set `custom-contextmenu.selectors` in your VS Code settings to hide context menu items by their label. Example:

```json
"custom-contextmenu.selectors": [
  "^Go to",
  "Cut",
  "Copy",
  "Paste",
  "_:has( + ^Find All)"
]
```

- Plain labels match exact labels (e.g., `"Copy"`).
- Prefix with `^` to match items that start with a label (e.g., `"^Go to"`).
- Separators are represented by the placeholder label `"_"`. Use `_:has( + ...)` to hide the separator that appears before the matched item, and use the `... + _` pattern to hide the separator after the matched item.

Separator examples:

```json
"custom-contextmenu.selectors": [
  "_:has( + Share)",
  "Share + _"
]
```

The first entry hides the separator immediately before the `Share` menu item (when present). The second entry hides the separator immediately after the `Share` menu item (when present). If you prefer the fully-quoted syntax, it still works (e.g., `"\"Share\" + \"_\""`).

> Note: `Paste + _` (or `Share + _`) only hides the separator after the item. To hide the menu item itself, add the item label separately (for example, include `"Paste"`).

> Note: after changing `custom-contextmenu.selectors`, re-enable the custom context menu or restart VS Code so the injected script is updated.

## Note:

All changes were made by ChatGPT (and I've got no idea how to make vscode extensions or do javascript, but this extension does seem to be working).
